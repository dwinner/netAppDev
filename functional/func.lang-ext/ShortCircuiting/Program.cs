// This tutorial shows how pipe-lining and the way Box's Map() and Bind() functions work, allow for short-circuiting through the validation step in (VETL - Validate, Extract, Transform and Lift)
// and hows why this is useful.

// routines are still used

      // The way Box's validation step works in its Bind/Map functions says thet an empty box is invalid.
      // Further more we cannot process any boxes if even one box is empty:

      var result = from number1 in aBoxOfNumbers1
         from number2 in
            aBoxOfNumbers2 // this result causes the next Bind() to check see that its an invalid input and itself returns empty box and this repeats until the result is deemed empty
         from number3 in
            aBoxOfNumbers3 // this does run, but it just bails out at the Validation phase in the bind()'s VETL stage
         select number3;
