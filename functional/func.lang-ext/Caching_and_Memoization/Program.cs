      // Now because we've cached decrypted results for phrases, when we see that encrypted phrase we can use the cached decrypted result for that encrypted phrase to get 
      // without having to run the SimpleDecrypt() function again. This is the same with all caching mechanism, which make the obvious seem transparent, however with a pure function, you know for certain that 
      // there is no chance that our cached decrypted result could be different from running a SimpleDecrypt() on the encrypted string we have - so we have double certainty that we
      // don't have to run the SimpleDecrypt() function. If SimpleEncrypt() or SimpleDecrypt() could sometimes return different outputs for the same input, then we'd have to cal SimpleDecrypt()
      // to return what the decrypted result is that/this time.

      // Note using Monads, Select, Bind() within your functions you're making it unlikely that you functions will ever throw exceptions becasue you're catering for both the expected and unexpected data 
      // by virtue of using Monads (which ensure that you need to ie. they contain both failure and success logic such as Some/None or Either left or right emedded into themselves so you can and indeed have to cater for them)
