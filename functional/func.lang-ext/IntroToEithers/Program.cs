// This tutorial shows you what a what an Either<> type is and how to use it generally

using System;
using LanguageExt;

const string word = "five";

// Note: We're creating either with the left type as int and the right type as string.
// You can assign either type to an either
Either<int, string> amount = 5;
amount = word;
var emptyEither = new Either<int, string>();

// Note you can do the same transformations you did on a Box<T> on an Either because it too is a Monad
// and it too has a Bind(), Map(), Select() and SelectMany() extension method.
// This transformation occurs on the right hand value, provided that the either contains the right hand
// value and not the left (this is the inbuilt validation or short-circuiting Monad idea in action)

// Extract EitherData from either once validated ie that not a right value, run transform function.
var resultA = amount.Bind(TransformRight);

amount = 25;

// notice that it's biased to its right value and only cares about running a transform on a right type.
// The validation within Either's Bind() will check for a Right Type and then run the provided transform,
// if its left it will return what it has (25) but no transform will occur
// Won't run transformation because the validation will fail because it is a left type.
var resultB = amount.Bind(TransformRight);

Console.WriteLine(
   $"The value of result is '{resultA}' and the result of result b is '{resultB}' and an empty either looks like this '{emptyEither}' ");
return;

// notice how Either's bind function will extract the right part, if validation succeeds and runs the transformation as expected.
Either<int, string> TransformRight(string extractedRight)
{
   // Like all Bind functions we need to lift the result into the monad ie Either type
   Either<int, string> result = extractedRight.ToUpper();
   return result;
